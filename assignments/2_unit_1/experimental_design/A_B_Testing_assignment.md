# Assignment
For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer.
Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.

Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
1. Two Versions (A & B): Placebo (control) and New Supplement (test)
2. Sample (groups): Sample of general population (perhaps those with sleeping difficulties) separated into two random/like groups
3. Hypothesis: The supplement will have an effect on the sleep of the test group over that of the placebo/control group 
4. Outcome(s) (key metric): Measure of quality of sleep, perhaps generate an overall sleep score based off of other variables
5. Other Variables: Including, but not limited to length of sleep, depth of sleep, waking from sleep, snoring, etc.

Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
1. Two Versions (A & B): Old Uniforms (control) and New Uniforms (test)
2. Sample (groups): Depends, if this is a single gym, then perhaps run a test period with the new uniforms for a certain amount of time, if it's a gym chain, then it may be better to test run the new uniforms in half of the gym chains 'like gyms' while maintaining the old uniforms in the other 'like gyms'
3. Hypothesis: The new uniform group will either have an effect (positive or negative) on a business component or not 
4. Outcome(s) (key metric): A business component (perhaps sales, retention rate (members), new members, etc.) will be affected by the change in uniforms
5. Other Variables: In the case of a single gym or a chain there are many variables to consider especially crafting the two samples. In the case where there is a single gym, seasonality becomes very important (the business component you will be measuring will likely be compared to prior years' over the same period or compared to the forecasted measurment with all the variables being the same). In the case that the gym is a chain, it will be important that the gyms where the new uniform is tested have a similar gym to compare to (demographics, avg sales, membership rate, location type, etc.) 

Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
1. Two Versions (A & B): Old Homepage (control) and New Homepage (test)
2. Sample (groups): Show a different homepage to different users, one half will see the old homepage and the other half will see the new one
3. Hypothesis: The new homepage will have a positive effect on sales
4. Outcome(s) (key metric): Sales
5. Other Variables: Demographics of users (if available try to ensure two samples are randomly selected, but also separated by particular demographics such as sex, age, prior purchases, etc.)

If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

1. Two Versions (A & B): Standard Header (control) and 'Please Read' Subject Header
2. Sample (groups): Half will see the standard, unchanged subject header, the other half will see the 'Please Read' included Subject header
3. Hypothesis: The 'Please Read' type subject header will have more readers/viewers than the one without
4. Outcome(s) (key metric): Email Views/Reads
5. Other Variables: Who are you sending these to? What is the purpose of the email? Are some emails inherently more important than others? Do we know anything about the individuals receiving these emails? If so use all the info that we can gather.
