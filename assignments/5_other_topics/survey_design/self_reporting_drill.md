# DRILL: When to use surveys

State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.

- Popularity of various Uber drivers. --> I believe Uber already has a system set up for rating their drivers, in essense having customer/driver ratings for every ride.
-  A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream.  --> It would probably be more useful to use the sales data they probably already have and compare the sales for the different flavors of ice cream.
- Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people. --> Tough one, but almost absolutely has to be done using surveys, the content is just too sensitive for any other study. However, there's potential for a lot of bias in this survey.
- Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. --> Digging into the already held data or searching for other reasons why this may happen would probably be a better way to find this out. However, a simple customer survey as to "Why did you choose HappyCars?", could be a useful survey in this case.
- Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. --> Hopefully this would show in the result of whatever metric you were trying to influence using the advertising. Similar to the HappyCars example, a simple, "Have you heard of this campaign?", could be a cheap and potentially useful way to garner knowedge or interest in the campaign. 
- Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards. --> This one is almost absolutely best to dig into the data. I don't think a survey would do much to help here.
