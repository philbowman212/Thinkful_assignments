# DRILL #1: Question Design
For each of the following, indicate the best question type to use and why.

- Age

    Depends heavily on the goal of the survey! Could be multiple choice with age ranges or could be above or below a certain cutoff (e.g. "Are you 18 or older?"). Could do write in too, but probably want to limit type of response to numbers only (within a certain acceptable range). I think the standard is more of an age range.
    
- Gender

    This question has become more difficult to form as gender identity has become a more sensitive subject as of late. Multiple choice or write in is probably best here. Write in could make it difficult to seperate however. It is likely most realistic to use multiple choice. You just have to make sure to be inclusive and as unbiased as possible.
    
- Income

    Could also be tricky. Could do write in, could do multiple choice with ranges, could do less than or greater than, depends on the goal of the survey really!
    
- Opinions about dish soap

    Write in or rating scale. Depends on what you want to know about the soap.
    
- Brand of dish soap used

    Multiple choice is probably best here (but have to be careful to get as many brands as possible - or at least the ones the survey is interested in).
    
- Preference for dish soap brand (Cleany, Sudsy, DeGreaser, Pinesoft)

    Depends on goal. Could do multiple choice, could do rating scale, could do ranking.
    
- Positive vs negative feelings about dish soap

    Rating scale or perhaps yes/no. Depends on goal.
    
# DRILL #2: Fix the flaw
Here is a [link](https://action.donaldjtrump.com/mainstream-media-accountability-survey/) to a Mainstream Media Accountability Survey sent to the public by the Trump Administration in February 2017. Read over the survey and select five questions you believe can be improved. Describe the flaw you see and write an improved version of the question. For example, if the original question is: "Americans are not fully aware just how much waste there is in the federal government." Yes No No Opinion

The flaw is that this is a loaded question that presupposes the respondent agrees that there is waste in the federal government. To ask this question in a less-biased way, it would need to be converted to two questions:

Select the option that describes your opinion of how the federal government handles money:
- Wastefully
- Efficiently
- No Opinion

IF they selected a, then:

Describe American public opinion about government waste.

0 (Unaware) 1 2 (Somewhat Aware) 3 4 (Fully Aware)

For each revised question, your version should attempt to get an unbiased picture of the respondent's opinion on the issue. Share your reasoning with your mentor.

ORIG: Do you trust the mainstream media to put the interests of Americans first?

NEW: What is your opinion of mainstream media's trustworthiness?

ORIG: Do you trust the mainstream media to report fairly on our presidency?

NEW: What is your opinion of the mainstream media's reporting on the presidency?

ORIG: Do you trust NBC to fairly report on our presidency?

NEW: What is your opinion of NBC's reporting on the presidency?

ORIG: What television source do you primarily get your news from?

NEW: Perhaps as a preface to the entire survey it should ask the participant which news outlets they watch in the first place and how much they watch each channel (to what degree/how many hours/wk/day/etc)! How can a participant realistically rate the trustworthiness of a news outlet if they haven't even watched that particular channel?! Ha.

ORIG: On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing President Trump?

NEW: What is your opinion of mainstream media's representation of President Trump on these issues? Give a scale perhaps from 0 to 5 or something for each issue and the media's overall rating on portrayal of that issue.
