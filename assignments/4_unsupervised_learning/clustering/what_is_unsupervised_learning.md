1.  Assume that we have a dataset of images that includes the images of red wines, white wines, red roses and white roses. If you were to cluster these observations, how would you do that? Would you like to cluster them with respect to their colors or anything else? Discuss the pros and cons of different clustering options.

	There are many things to consider here, including indicator for detection of transparency in the glass, the shape of the object, detection of a glass, and so many other possibilities. I believe the simplest would be color, shape, detection of glass (assuming the wine is in a wine glass).
	
2.  A shadow on the wall is a two-dimensional representation of a real world three-dimensional object. When you see a rabbit and a cat, you can easily identify them. But, are they also easily identifiable by just looking at their shadows on a wall? What information is retained and lost when representing 3-d objects in 2-dimensional space

	In this case the direction at which the light is coming from as well as the way the rabbit/cat is sitting with respect to that light is a very important aspect in this case. Ultimately, we'd want the "shadow" with the most defining features for a cat or a rabbit. If the view is from the side, I think it would generally be easier to identify cat/rabbit in shadow terms. The angle of view is everything here.
