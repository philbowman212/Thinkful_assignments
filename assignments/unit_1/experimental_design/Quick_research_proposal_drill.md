## DRILL: Make a quick research proposal

Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

### The Situation

The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

### The Problem

How do the Sith Lords increase their Dark Side conversion rate?

Why is this important? In order for the Sith Lords to rule the galaxy, they must have a healthy influx of Dark Side converts, or else their numbers will dwindle (and the Resistance will have an easier time dealing with them). Based on the above situation, they already have a slogan, "Give in to your anger". We aren't sure how effective it is because the above experiment is not well put together. In this situation the potential converts are also captured droids, which begs the question: is this the most effective method of obtaining potential recruits? But that can be for another potential proposal. It is assumed that the slogan has a large effect on whether a droid will convert or not - so that will be of critical importance in the test.

### The Potential Solution

Offer a change to the Dark Side slogan with, "Together we can rule the galaxy", in order to increase Dark Side conversion rates.

### The Method

This will be an A/B test where the original slogan, "Give in to your anger", will be pitted against the alternative slogan, "Together we can rule the galaxy".

If we already have data on the conversion rates with the original slogan, we will use that as a baseline. 

If we do not have prior data, we will first conduct an A/B test for the original slogan on at least 100 captured droids split into two groups of half the size of the sample using Darth Vader for one of the groups and Palpatine for the other. The point of this experiment will be to see who is more effective at converting droids using the original slogan.

Once we have our prior data, we will test the new slogan using either Palpatine or Darth Vader (whoever was more effective in the past). Regardless of the Sith Lord used, we will conduct A/B experiments on 100 or more captured droids (similar to the prior data) split into equal groups. The first group (A) will hear the original slogan, "Give in to your anger", professed by one of our Sith Lords. Then the second group (B) will hear, "Together we can rule the galaxy", professed by the same Sith Lord.

The conversion rates from the two groups will then be measured and compared to our prior conversion rates with the chosen Sith Lord. If the conversion rate in group A is within 5% of the expected conversion rate based on our prior data, we can assume our Sith Lord was consistent in his performance and the droids are similar. If this is true and group B's conversion rate is 10% higher or more than that of group A, then we will adopt the alternative slogan. If group B's conversion rate is 10% lower or more than that of group A, then we will continue to use the original slogan. If group B's conversion rate falls within 10% higher or lower than group A, then run the experiment again.
