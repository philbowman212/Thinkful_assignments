## Assignment

### 1. Try to model the result of a coin toss. In your model, include any features that you think important in explaining the result. Discuss with your mentor about the pros and cons of adding too many features into your model.
    
Possible features:
- Spin
- Weight
- Fairness of coin
- Starting side
- Etc...etc.
    
    
### 2. If you ever used Netflix, you should already have realized that it provides some recommendations for you to watch. In data science, this is an example of the so-called **recommendations systems**. Read this nontechnical blog post of [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639) about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model.

Features:
- viewing history
- ratings
- members with similar rating/history
- movie information
- when you watch
- where you watch
- how long you watch
- recency in viewing a title (more recent is weighed higher)
      
Possible Features:
- demographics
- similarity score between titles (I'm sure something like this is already being done)
- newness of title
