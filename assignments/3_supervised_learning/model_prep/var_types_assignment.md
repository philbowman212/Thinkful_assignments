## Assignment

1. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of treating the *Rank* variable as categorical. Discuss your arguments with your mentor.

    *If we think of a rank variable as ordinal categorical instead of interval continuous then the main disadvantage is the loss of meaning of the distance between the ranks. The order still matters, but the distance between them does not. Depending on what we are looking for with the data, ordinal categorical may be more useful if we are attempting to get a general idea of the differences between groups of the ranks, however.*
    
2. What are the types of the following variables?
    * Age - *Ratio Continuous or Ordinal Categorical depending on how you look at it or what your goals are.*
    * Salary - *Ratio Continuous unless you break it down into categorical groups, in which case it could be Ordinal Categorical.*
    * Revenue - *Ratio Continuous, but again could be broken down into groups and become Ordinal Categorical.*
    * Customer type - *Nominal Categorical is the only thing that makes sense here, unless certain customer types bring more value to the company, then it could be Ordinal Categorical perhaps.*
    * Stock price - *Ratio Continuous, but again could be broken down to Ordinal Categorical if desired.*
