To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below. For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning and discuss your answers with your mentor."

For example if each column was a count of words in a particular document, if the documents are small it may be best to use Bernoulli Naive Bayes (still try Multinomial Naive Bayes as well). K-Nearest Neighbors could be good to use here as well (since we have limited data but many dimensions). Any number of models can be used here, it's likely best to pare down the columns to the most essential first through feature selection regardless. LASSO regression could be used to identify the most 'important' variables for this particular dataset/outcome."
