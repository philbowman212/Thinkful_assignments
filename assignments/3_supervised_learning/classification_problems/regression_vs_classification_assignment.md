# Assignment
For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model. Discuss your reasoning with your mentor next time you meet.

1. The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.

    For this regression appears to be the most appropriate method as the outcome variable is likely continuous. Unless the amounts were listed as Low/Med/High where classification may be more appropriate.
    
2. What color car someone is going to buy.

    This more than likey falls within a classification problem, unless the colors were on a spectrum of some sort. If the colors are a discrete number of colors then a classification model is likely most appropriate.
    
3. How many children a family will have.

    This could likely be a regression or classification problem, it depends on how the target variable is evaluated/defined.
    
4. If someone will sign up for a service.

    More than likely a classification problem where the outcome variable is (yes/no).
    
5. The number of times someone will get sick in a year.

    Could be classification or regression, regression may generally be better here, depends on the data available concerning the target variable.
    
6. The probability someone will get sick in the next month.

    This could be classification or regression as well. Again, depends on the outcome variable. Regression may generally work better, but where classifier is a probability of a particular result will work as well.
    
7. Which medicine will work best for a given patient.

    If there are a discrete amount of medicines then classification is likely the superior method.
