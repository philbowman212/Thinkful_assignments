    "The **goal** of this project is to *find topics from a corpus of song lyric data using unsupervised modeling techniques, and from those topics, find common clusters for the lyrics and potentially create tags for songs*. The data source for this project is the [380,000+ Lyrics from MetroLyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics) dataset collected by the Kaggle user [GyanendraMishra](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95). There are many questions to consider when modeling with this type of data. \n",
    "- How will the lyrics be represented?\n",
    "- What models should be used in this case?\n",
    "- How will the models interpret the lyrics? \n",
    "- How will the models differentiate between the lyrics? \n",
    "- How is a model's effectiveness measured?\n",
    "- What is the \"best\" model?\n",
    "- What are the limitations to this method?\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope to answer most of the above questions with this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, a few quick and easy definitions of words that will be commonly used in the project:\n",
    "- Lyrics/text/words: these will be used relatively interchangeably and could refer to either the string form of the data or tokenized form of data (essentially, these are the words in the songs)\n",
    "- Corpus: The entire collection of lyrics (i.e. all the songs)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to define the kind of data that is being worked with as well as the limitations of the data. This data is a collection of lyrics that was scraped from the MetroLyrics website. It is not cleaned and is in its raw textual format. Some lyrics, if not all, have initially been entered (typed) by hand and thus may contain misspellings and errors. This data is not perfect, but should be a useful base for topic modeling and clustering songs by their lyrical content. With that said, there are other limitations that will be set on the initial dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further scope and limitations of the project are as follows:\n",
    "1. Any songs prior to 2006 will be removed (10 year range)\n",
    "2. Non-English songs will be removed\n",
    "3. Non-lyrics and N/A data will be removed\n",
    "4. Extremely long and extremely short lyrics will be removed\n",
    "5. It's not going to be perfect (but it should be pretty good)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook's goal is to understand the contents of the raw dataset and transform it in a way that is conducive to the next stage of the project (Text Cleaning and Data Exploration)."
