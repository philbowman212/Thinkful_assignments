    "## Purpose:\n",
    "To explain, clean and explore the aggregated data from `nba_agg_data.csv` (aggregated in the prior notebook, [NBA Data Aggregation](https://github.com/philbowman212/Thinkful_repo/blob/master/projects/supervised_capstone/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Data_Aggregation.ipynb)). Then execute feature engineering on our features to get them into a predictive format. Finally, limit those features to only those that are essential to explaining most of variance for the outcome variable. In essense, this is the Exploratory Data Analysis of the aggregated NBA regular season game level box score/standings/betting data spanning the 2012-2013 to 2017-2018 seasons (6 seasons)."

The reason for this is that basically all of these can change in the future, or they have more descriptive/analogous versions in the numerical set. For the categorical variables of streak type and the like, better variables have already been derived from similar data. Therefore categorical variables for this dataset will be removed. Also team name and division will be removed as well, it's likely these are very strong indicators for particular teams and divisions. However, these things can change drastically over time. In order to keep relatively consistent results over the years, it will primarily be game and season aggregate statistics and features derived from those that will be included in the primary feature set."
