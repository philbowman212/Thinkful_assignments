    "## Overview:\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a movie recommendation system with a twist: to recommend obscure/relatively unknown movies. Think of it as a hidden gem detector for films. The product's application will include the ability to enter keywords or another movie title, then generate a list of obscure movies that are highly associated with the query. The data used comes from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) by means of one of their various APIs.\n",

    "Movie recommendations and their systems are pretty much ubiquitous in this day and age. But what if you want to watch something that isn't as popular or well known to the general movie goer? For individuals who want to be the first to watch a new movie in their friend group; for those movie buffs who want to round out their awareness; or for those who are just getting bored of the same old movie recommendations over and over again - this is the movie recommendation system that they need to use. By using a content based recommender system with the caveat that the movies recommended should be obscure enough that you've probably never heard of them: you'll be watching some new, interesting and memorable films. The question then arises, how is obscure defined? What makes a movie relatively unknown?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, an obscure movie will be defined as a movie that falls under a certain threshold for number of ratings. The data collected includes information on the number of ratings submitted for any particular movie. Therefore, some deep digging will be done for this particular variable to identify an appropriate amount of ratings for a hard cutoff. In the future, it may be of use to create a more robust system for defining obscurity in the context of this problem. For now, in this prototypical phase, a hard cutoff with respect to the volume of ratings is prudent. Note, this threshold will likely create a general limitation as to the definition of obscurity. Movies that may have been considered to be obscure at release, but have since garnered a cult following, by this definition, will not be considered obscure. Also, movies that are recently released or soon to be released will not be included as a prerequisite for knowing if something is obscure since those movies have not yet had time to garner \"popularity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So to solve this threshold for obscurity, a deep dive into the data must be conducted. But first, a quick explanation of the data collection process should be understood."

    "As mentioned previously, the data was collected from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (aka TMDb). This source has been grown and built exclusively by its community since 2008. They have an extremely large record of movies and television shows. One of its big selling points is the user friendly nature of the database. They have a very large number of APIs in multiple languages for use in querying their database. For this project, I utilized [tmdbv3api](https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/tmdbv3api), \"A lightweight Python library for The Movie Database (TMDb) API.\" Using this API in a Python script, [`data_collection.py`](https://github.com/philbowman212/Thinkful_repo/blob/master/projects/final_capstone/data_collection.py), movies and their relevant information were collected and stored in comma separated value format. The data includes many variables regarding each movie: overview, title, genre, id, original language, popularity, tagline, runtime, cast/crew, and more. In all, nearly 400,000 movies and their relevant data were collected. A quick snippet of how a movie's data was collected is below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "movie = Movie()\n",
    "current_movie = movie.details(page_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, the actual script is more verbose as it iterates over numerous `page_id`s and saves each run in a particular batch; it also skips over IDs that don't exist and films that are marked adult. But the above is essentially how the data was collected for every single movie. Extremely user friendly and simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "When all was said and done, there were a total of 45 CSV files of varying length and size containing information on 390,000 movies from TMDb. Considering TMDb currently claims to have [533,814 movies](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/general) as of this project's creation, that means over 75% of all their movies have been collected for utilization in this project. This should hopefully make for a good basis for a recommendation system model. But before making a model, the data must first be explored and put into a context that a model can utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, it would be wise to collect and maintain the entire database and update changes made to films as they are updated, but for the prototyping phase, this was not done. It's best to make sure a model of some value could be created from a sample of the data before deploying it and setting up all the infrastructure needed to maintain all that information (i.e. if a good model is not found, that's a lot of overhead for nothing)."

And for one to explore data, it also must be wrangled in a reasonable way, initially. In the data collection step, the data was partially wrangled by means that only potentially relevant information was collected for each movie.

Along the way some fun facts were discovered and an overall understanding of this data was created. Also, a pool of movies that are considered to be obscure and fit into the definitions and limitations of what obscure means in this context was produced for future use. The next logical step was to create some models using all the text data available and see if some reasonable recommendations could be made!"

    "After that selection was made, a filter had to be created to limit the results to only those movies that were defined to be *obscure* in the data wrangling and exploration phase. This was pretty easy to do as the movies queried for their similarity were just limited to those in the pool of obscure movies. Next, the user shouldn't have to know the exact movie ID when querying movies similar to another. The TMDb API came in handy here as it has a very useful search feature, so that was implemented into the function in a GUI-like format. That way if you search for \"batman\" in the query, but actually want \"Batman & Robin\", the movie will likely appear on the first page of results (which is the page shared with the user). Then the user is instructed to enter the index for that particular movie on the page and the function finds the movie ID associated with that film. One future implementation to be added here should be a way to cycle through pages if the desired result is not on the first page returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the user shouldn't be limited to only searching movies by comparisons to other movies, the model should also be able to look for movies similar to a particular input determined solely by the words a user enters. So an additional query parameter was added to indicate when searching general words rather than film specific comparisons. This feature likely needs the most work as user input is likely going to be very sparse and high cosine similarities may be hard to generate. As it is, the more you enter, the better the recommendations should perform. With that being said, here is the final function call that actually gathers recommendations based on function parameters:\n",

    "```\n",
