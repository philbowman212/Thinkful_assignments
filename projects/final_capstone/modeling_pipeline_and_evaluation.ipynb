    "## Overview:\n",
    "Now that the movies and variables viable for use in this project have been identified. It is now time to create some models with the goal to find one that will appropriately identify movies similar to others, then on top of that, limit the responses of that model to those movies that have been deemed *obscure* by the definition and limitations made in the [Data Wrangling and Exploration](https://github.com/philbowman212/Thinkful_repo/blob/master/projects/final_capstone/data_wrangling_and_exploration.ipynb) notebook. Ultimately, the steps taken to go from the beginning to end with regards to the model will be put into a pipeline that can be called in one function.\n",

    "The prospective methods that could be used in a content recommender such as this are essentially endless. There are countless ways you could go about tokenizing text and numerous techniques when it comes to selecting corpus stop words and there's also the rules of the language itself. This project's intention is not to jump into the deep end of Natural Language Processing (NLP), but because any model's success is inherently connected to the textual data, it is important to take care when making decisions based on the text. For the most part, simple solutions that work are probably better than overcomplicated ones that are hard to explain. The goal here is to find a relatively simple solution by trying a few different methods and tuning each to find their \"best\" results:\n",
    "- Count vectorizer in conjunction with cosine similarity (the simplest)\n",
    "- Latent Dirichlet allocation in conjunction with cosine similarity (relatively simple with the added step of reducing dimensions to their latent topics first)\n",
    "- doc2vec (the most sophisticated of the three options presented, but also the most complicated)\n",

This is going to be a very sparse representation of the data (as most of the feature vectors will tend to be). But it should give a decent baseline for what should be expected moving forward. In other words, this is one of the most simple solutions possible and it's likely it will not perform very well. For this particular method (count vectorizer + cosine similarity), the best way to verify the results is to actually check some similarities and inspect their accuracy. This is where my domain knowledge comes into use (I've watched a decent amount of movies and I've often been told I should get into movie criticism/reviewing). Obviously, the results will be quite subjective and my knowledge of this industry is far from comprehensive, but you use what you've got, right?"

    "So after digging into these, the [top pick](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/205065) appears to be a movie about a family during the Vietnam war (which probably isn't too far off in topic). [Hicran Gecesi](themoviedb.org/movie/272721-hicran-gecesi) is a very obscure pick which appears to be about a love triangle. [Emil and the Piglet](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11947) appears to veer off in an interesting, unexpected direction. [An Education](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/24684) is a love story where the woman's name is Jenny. So definitely some interesting picks, but definitely far from perfect."

    "Alright, so overall, this model appears to be quite solid due to its insane simplicity, superfast runtime (which is important when searching for recommendations), and its surprisingly decent and seemingly accurate suggestions. The question becomes, can it get much better for a recommendation system from here? And also, if this model is ultimately used, the use case for the user comes into question. Will they search for a particular movie (like the above) and get the most similar obscure movies to that film? Or will they be able to enter text freely, where the count vectorizer will transform their text in the same manner as it did all the movie information, then query the most similar obscure films based on that result? Or perhaps it could do both? Enter a movie title or enter text freely. This is probably the best method, perhaps a simple movie search function could be created that performs the former and a free text function will perform the latter. Luckily TMDb API makes it very easy to search for a movie title (that will definitely come in handy)."

    "These results are certainly interesting. It looks as if things are loosely connected: very loose. Perhaps a greater number of topics is needed? Maybe more terms as well? The drawback of LDA is that it takes a decent amount of time to train. This particular instance took 17 minutes. Definitely a knock against this method in comparison to the super simple one in the prior section. With unlimited computing power, this could turn up with some interesting and useful results, but it looks like it would require a lot of tuning and time for that to happen. But we'll give it a few more tries. One with double the count vectorizer features (10000), one with double the topic features (200)."
